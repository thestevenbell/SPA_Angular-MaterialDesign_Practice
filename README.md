# SPA_Angular-MaterialDesign_Template

## [Project Repo](https://github.com/thestevenbell/SPA_Angular-MaterialDesign_Template.git)

### Project Description
Gulp, Jade, SASS and BrowserSync are powerful tools to make web development easier and more efficient.


### Tech Tools:
- Angular v1
- Jade
- Material Design for Angular v1
- Scss
- BrowserSync
- Node

## STILL TO DO:
- make dist folder, pipe all assets into it via gulp, refactor Gulpfile.serve method to read from the dist folder and to watch/detect changes in dist folder

### Directions for use:

- Assumes Mac dev environment, Ruby and NodeJS installed
- cd into your working folder
- clone or copy this repo into working folder
- run the following in bash:

    $ `npm install --global gulp-cli`         <-- installs gulp-cli globally

    $ `npm install --global gulp` <-- installs gulp globally

    $ `gem install sass`   # or `gem update sass` if you have sass already

    $ `npm init`  <-- initilizes this project with NPM

    $ `npm install`  <-- installs the file dependencies included in the package.json file

    $ `gulp serve` <-- use this command to start gulp services.  This will automatically
    open your server at localhost and precompile SASS and Jade assets on save allowing for
    instantaneous in-browser views of updates.


- The following steps were used to create the file contents of this repo:

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-sass`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-jade`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-util`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-load-plugins`

    $ `npm install --save node-bourbon`

    $ `npm install —-save node-neat`

    $ `npm install —-save bourbon`

    $ `npm install --save-dev browser-sync`



### Directory Structure and File Explanation:
> NOTE: This section is in progress -->
website/  <-- the main working directory, name this whatevs you would like
  .sas-cache  <-- auto generated by gulp, don't touch, not used directly by developer
  /img  <-- includes custom favicons.  replase these with your own but be sure to keep the names the same




### Automation
- Gulp is set up to automate the precomplitation of resources and open the browser with
browsersync.  Simply input $ `gulp` in the command line.
- If you do not want to open the browser to use BrowserSync it is possible to
initiate only the precompilers independently.
 - To precompile SASS use $ `gulp styles`
 - To precompile Jade use $ `gulp jade`
 - To only run the server $ `gulp serve`
